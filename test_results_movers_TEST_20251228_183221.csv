SMCI,2024,2,GAINER,Supermicro,Technology,True,,134.05,DOWN,0.4,139.68,False,"Management delivered a blowout quarter with record $3.66B revenue, EPS beat and materially higher FY guidance, which is likely to drive positive analyst revisions and demand momentum over the next month. Offsetting that, the company burned substantial operating cash (~$595M) and negative FCF (~$610M) while building inventory and drawing on credit, creating near‑term funding and working‑capital sensitivity that could cap the rally.

**Summary: The most important 30‑day bullish driver is the step‑","[""financials: Revenue hit ~$3.66B (first >$3B), a step-change from the prior quarter\u2019s ~$2.12B (+~73% QoQ) and followed by a more \u201cnormalized\u201d climb to ~$3.85B the next quarter (+~5% QoQ). Gross profitability looks steady through the ramp: implied gross margin is ~15.4% (gross profit $564M on $3.665B) versus ~16.7% in the prior quarter and ~15.5% in the following quarter, consistent with the reported non-GAAP gross margin of 15.5%. Operating leverage improved modestly (non-GAAP operating margin 11.3% vs 10.8% last quarter) even as OpEx rose (non-GAAP OpEx $153M, +18% QoQ), suggesting the business scaled without a margin collapse; however, the two different YoY revenue growth quotes (133% vs 103%) are a notable messaging inconsistency (often driven by different comps/definitions) and worth reconciling in a model.\n\nCash flow is the standout swing: operations used ~$595M (vs +$271M prior quarter), driving FCF to about -$610M despite low CapEx ($15M). That pattern continues into the next quarter historically (operating CF about -$1.51B), implying working-capital demands are the main near-term risk even while reported working-capital metrics improved (CCC 61 days vs 86; DIO and DSO down sharply). Liquidity was supported by a ~$583M net equity raise, leaving ~$726M cash and net cash ~$350M (down vs prior quarter), which is a positive backstop for growth\u2014but the combination of rapid scale + recurring negative FCF flags ongoing funding/working-capital sensitivity as a key item for near-term forecasting and valuation."", ""past calls: The \u201chistorical excerpts\u201d you provided (2024\u2011Q1, 2023\u2011Q4, 2023\u2011Q3) are almost entirely operator remarks + IR intro + forward\u2011looking statement disclaimer, so there isn\u2019t enough substantive management commentary here to directly compare tone, themes, or guidance across quarters. That said, the *current quarter facts* you listed for 2024\u2011Q2 would typically support a much more upbeat headline message than prior periods: record scale ($3.66B; first quarter >$3B), triple\u2011digit YoY growth (even though management/CFO cite different YoY percentages), and slightly improved operating margin vs last quarter. Offsetting that, the sharp swing to negative operating cash flow / free cash flow is the kind of datapoint management usually has to contextualize (working capital, inventory/build\u2011ahead, customer ramps), which can introduce a more \u201cexplain the cash\u201d undertone alongside the celebratory growth narrative.\n\nRecurring themes you can see even from the limited history are the standard emphasis on (1) revenue/growth, (2) margin and operating expense discipline, and (3) formal framing around guidance/outlook and risk factors. In 2024\u2011Q2 specifically, the recurring \u201cinvestor concerns\u201d likely cluster around profitability durability (15.5% non\u2011GAAP GM; OpEx up materially YoY), financing/interest + FX impacts (net other expense ~$16M), and especially cash conversion (negative FCF of ~$610M) despite strong EPS\u2014i.e., \u201cearnings strength vs cash use.\u201d\n\nNotable changes in guidance/outlook can\u2019t be assessed from what\u2019s pasted: the historical text only says guidance *exists* (and for which future quarters), but contains no numbers or directional outlook; your 2024\u2011Q2 facts also don\u2019t include explicit forward guidance.

Growth is where SMCI stands out: management cited **+133% YoY** (CFO: **+103% YoY**), which is extraordinary for a company at multi\u2011billion quarterly revenue scale and typically implies much stronger near-term demand momentum than mature mega-caps. Profitability is solid but not best-in-class: **15.5% non-GAAP gross margin** and **11.3% non-GAAP operating margin** (up from 10.8% last quarter) suggest operating leverage, but many software/platform peers often sustain higher net margins (e.g., ADBE\u2019s net income margin is roughly **1.57/5.31 \u2248 30%**, AAPL\u2019s **23.64/90.75 \u2248 26%**; by contrast ACN is ~**12%**).\n\nOn \u201csector outperformance,\u201d SMCI looks like an **outperformer on growth and earnings momentum** (non-GAAP diluted EPS **$5.59**) but **underperforms on cash conversion this quarter**: operating cash flow swung to **-$595M** and free cash flow to **-$610M** (despite only **$15M** CapEx), partially offset by a **$583M** equity raise.

Overall pattern: accelerating growth plus expanding profitability and cash conversion (positive), offset by revenue volatility between quarters and a capital structure that remains debt-heavy (the main concern)."", ""past calls: Management\u2019s tone in the current-quarter facts reads consistent with the last three calls: confident, execution-focused, and framed as \u201cstrength building on strength.\u201d In 2023-Q4 through 2024-Q2 they repeatedly emphasize outperforming/growing (e.g., \u201csurpassed the high-end,\u201d \u201crecord quarter,\u201d \u201cstrong quarter\u201d) and attribute it to product/model improvements (AXON/models). The Q3 framing adds a more explicit \u201cscale narrative\u201d (1.4B daily actives; 45 minutes of daily attention) alongside the financial anchor ($1.2B revenue), which is a slightly broader message aimed at reinforcing the durability of demand and monetization runway, not just quarter-to-quarter performance.\n\nRecurring themes are: (1) sustained momentum after a difficult 2022 and a \u201cpattern\u201d of strong results, (2) algorithm/model-driven performance in the software business as the primary driver of growth, and (3) disciplined investor messaging (repeated emphasis on filings, non-GAAP, and risk factors). Concerns are not foregrounded in the excerpts beyond standard cautionary language; instead, the consistent throughline is confidence in continuing improvements and scaling outcomes.\n\nOn guidance/outlook: the provided historical snippets don\u2019t include explicit guidance ranges, so a quantitative \u201cchange in guidance\u201d comparison isn\u2019t possible here.

APP delivered 39% YoY revenue growth (and 66% in its core Software Platform) alongside a 60% adjusted EBITDA margin and 91% revenue-to-EBITDA flow-through\u2014signaling much stronger near-term operating leverage than mature peers typically exhibit. By comparison, peers here show solid but more \u201csteady-state\u201d profitability on a GAAP basis (net income margins roughly ~10% for ACN up to ~31% for ADBE, with AAPL ~25%), and their scale tends to dampen growth rates and incremental margins versus a faster-scaling platform model like APP\u2019s.\n\nOn sector relative performance, APP is *outperforming on momentum and cash generation*: $545M of Q3 free cash flow (+182% YoY, +22% QoQ) and 76% EBITDA-to-FCF conversion imply high-quality earnings conversion and near-term capital flexibility (buybacks, reinvestment, de-levering) that can support valuation in the short run. The key advantages are (1) exceptionally high incremental margins (flow-through near/above 100% in the segment QoQ), and (2) rapid profitability growth (adj. EBITDA +72% YoY; segment adj. EBITDA +79% YoY), which is unusual in large-cap tech at this point in the cycle.\n\nNotable disadvantages vs. these peers are primarily *risk and durability factors*: APP\u2019s results are more concentrated (Software Platform drives most profit with a 78% segment EBITDA margin), and advertising/software platform economics can be more sensitive to demand cycles, measurement/privacy changes, and partner/platform policies than diversified hardware/services (AAPL) or mission-critical enterprise software/services (ADBE/ADSK/ACN).
